# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design:

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
Sample type: Cross-sectional, probability-based sample drawn from the general population aged 15+ in the 10 Canadian provinces

Sample size: Approximately 16,149 respondents aged 15+

Target population: Non‚Äëinstitutionalized residents of the 10 provinces aged 15+, excluding Yukon, Nunavut, NWT, and institutions

Sampling frame: Telephone numbers available from Census, administrative sources, and dwelling frame 

Survey modes: Combined telephone interviews and newly introduced self-administered online questionnaires in 2018

Timeline: Fielded from September‚ÄØ4 to December‚ÄØ28,‚ÄØ2018

Overall response: 41.9% **Note: alternative sources mention ~59.5% in 2018‚Äîthis may reflect different calculation methods or definitions

Weights: Person-level weight (WGHT_PER) for national representativeness
Post-stratification to align with age-sex province benchmarks; adjustments for non-response
Bootstrap replicate weights provided to compute design-based variance

Data processing: CATI data editing - Real-time checks during interviews 
Income data: Linked to 2017 tax data (T1) for 81.9% respondents, missing values are imputed

Sampling error: Addressed via bootstrap variance estimation

Coverage errors: Exclusion of those without phones; addressed via weighting

Mode changes: Introduction of online mode could pose a potential break in comparability with earlier data

Geographical/institutional exclusions: No data from territories or institutional residents.

Limitations: 
Comparability: 2018 results not directly comparable with prior waves due to substantial methodological changes (like the introduction of the online mode) 

Residual bias: Despite adjustments, some populations (e.g., unreachable households) may remain underrepresented

Response definition variance: Different response rate calculations across sources‚Äîinterpret carefully
